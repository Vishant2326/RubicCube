OpenGL is a software interface to graphics hardware. This interface consists of about150 
distinct commands that you use to specify the objects and operations needed to produce 
interactive three-dimensional applications.
OpenGL is designed as a streamlined, hardware-independent interface to be implemented 
on many different hardware platforms. To achieve these qualities, no commands for 
performing windowing tasks or obtaining user input are included in OpenGL; instead, you 
must work through whatever windowing system controls the particular hardware you're 
using. Similarly, OpenGL doesn't provide high-level commands for describing models of 
three-dimensional objects. Such commands might allow you to specify relatively 
complicated shapes such as automobiles, parts of the body, airplanes, or molecules. With 
OpenGL, you must build up your desired model from a small set of geometric primitives -
points, lines, and polygons.
